Haven't been able to get the map to display through GitHub or Neocities. It doesn't like that there is content in "site_libs" (which was generated when knitting the RMarkdown document).

Seems like the best/only way to verify the map works is to download the "NationalParks.html" file and the "site_libs" folder and then open the NationalParks.html file in a browser.
