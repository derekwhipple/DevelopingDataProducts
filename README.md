Haven't been able to get the map to display through GitHub or Neocities. It doesn't like that there is content in "site_libs" (which was generated when knitting the RMarkdown document).

Seems like the best/only way to verify the map works is to download the "NationalParks.html" file and the "site_libs" folder and then open the NationalParks.html file in a browser.

*** Update ***

Was able to eventually get it to render at URL: https://derekwhipple.github.io/NationalParks.html. Looks like I needed to:
1. Put the html file and site_libs folder into the gh-pages branch
2. Access the html site without many of the other parts of the GitHub URL hierarchy in the URL.
